# Eleventy from scratch

Semi-completed [Learn Eleventy](https://learn-eleventy.pages.dev) course, based on the fork maintained by [uncenter](https://github.com/uncenter/learn-eleventy).

Each lesson in the course is a separate git commit - hence the head of the main branch points to the last lesson completed. To see the progress after a specific lesson use `git log` to find the commit hash for the lesson and `git checkout <commit hash>` to switch to this commit. [uncenter](https://github.com/uncenter/) has a similar (semi) [completed version](https://github.com/uncenter/learn-eleventy-completed) of the course but using separate directories for each lesson.
